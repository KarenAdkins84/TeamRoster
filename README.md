# TeamRoster

## User Story
AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles

## Description
This is a CLI application that generates an HTML file that displays data from the user about their team, including name, id, email, and other information based on the user input. Unit tests were written for all classes and they all pass. 

## Installation and Use
Must install node.js and jest and inquirer.
Run npm test to run the tests.
Run node index.js to have the questions asked in the terminal.
User types answers in terminal and when the user chooses that they are finished building their team, the application terminates and an HTML file is generated.
